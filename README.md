### Pig Latin Exercise

For this exercise you are required to create a Pig Latin Converter app with Angular.

This converter will be required to:
 - Accept English Words (and or sentences)
 - Convert the words entered into Pig Latin
 - Output the Pig Latin version of the Word

You are optionally required to:

 - Keep a track of the history of the last 10 words/sentences and also display these

The Pig Latin converter can be written in any version/syntax of Angular and can use any functionality in Angular as required.

The app can also incorporate any feature of modern frontend development, e.g. Css PreProcessors, Build tools such as Grunt/Gulp, ES5+.

The only restriction is you cannot use something like jQuery and you cannot use any modules for angular or JS libraries which provide functionality for Pig Latin Conversion.

You can include third party libraries to do things like nicely output alerts, or CSS frameworks like Bootstrap/Foundation etc. if desired, to make the app feel more feature rich.

### Conversion Rules

As per Wikipedia’s article on Pig Latin [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin)

1. All words beginning with consonants should move the first letter to the end, and then add “ay” on the end.

E.g. “Pig” -> “igpay”

1. All words beginning with vowels (A, E, I, O, U) should move the first letter to the end, and then add “i” on the end.

E.g. “apple” -> “ppleai”
